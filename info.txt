Project Description:    Voyager is an intelligent agent that explores a given website and extracts data regarding how the website is
interconnected with other websites on the web and/or internally. It validates the links that the current website links
to by extracting all the links from the HTML source of the website and checking their availability. When Voyager finds
links, it sends them to a queue, so that when the current page is processed, Voyager goes on to process the links on the queue.
Voyager can also copy the entire content of a given website. The user can select the number of threads to process a given
website and download the pages and the content of the website.
If the user selects to enter a world wide voyage mode, then Voyager treats external links as internal and processes them as well.
Hypothetically, Voyager can explore the whole world wide web based on the availability of inter connectivity between websites.
